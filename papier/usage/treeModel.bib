Ce faisant, elle comporte aussi des dangers que le modélisateurs/simulateur doit savoir maîtriser. Le propos de ce court texte est de montrer que danger et enrichissement de la recherche vont de pair dans l’exercice de simulation. Ainsi, l’utilisation d’un appareillage formalisé est tout autant de nature à appauvrir qu’à enrichir notre tentative de compréhension des phénomènes sociaux. Le modèle de simulation joue alors un rôle heuristique très utile pour susciter de la complexité (enrichissement de notre vision) à partir de la simplicité (pauvreté du modèle). La souplesse du modèle et de son utilisation, permettant de refaire plusieurs fois l’expérience, de varier les angles d’approche, d’ajouter ou retrancher des paramètres donne au chercheur une grande capacité à maîtriser la complexité qu’il est alors capable d’instiller dans son investigation.},

	abstract = {Complex-systems describe multiple levels of collective structure and organization. In such systems, the emergence of global behaviour from local interactions is generally studied through large scale experiments on numerical models. This analysis generates important computation loads which require the use of multi-core servers, clusters or grid computing. Dealing with such large scale executions is especially challenging for modellers who don't possess the theoretical and methodological skills required to take advantage of high performance computing environments. That's why we have designed a cloud approach for model experimentation. This approach has been implemented in OpenMOLE (Open MOdel Experiment) as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that leverages the naturally parallel aspect of model experiments. The OpenMOLE DSL has been designed to explore user-supplied models. It delegates transparently their numerous executions to remote execution environment. From a user perspective, those environments are viewed as services providing computing power, therefore no technical detail is ever exposed. This paper presents the OpenMOLE DSL through the example of a toy model exploration and through the automated calibration of a real-world complex system model in the field of geography.},

This posture is based on a cycling approach, in interaction with field processes, including discussion of assumptions and feedbacks on the field process. Confrontation between field and modelling processes has to be permanent because of openness and uncertainty features of these systems.

This approach is used with two possible aims: learn on systems or support collective decision processes in these systems, which corresponds to an objective of increasing knowledge either for the scientist or the field actors, always through an interaction between them mediated by an evolutionary model. Both aims lead to different implementations of this companion modelling approach, but each one is side effect of the other one, and has to be taken in account as such. Scientists ready to work in that way and make this posture alive are kindly invited to join.},

	abstract = {Avec l'utilisation de systèmes multi-agents dans un contexte de modélisation d'accompagnement, la question de la validation de modèle est le plus souvent reléguée aux moments où l'on sera amené à publier sur des résultats. On invoque souvent le statut donné au modèle qui n'a pas vocation à dépasser le cadre KILT (Keep It a Learning Tool) (Le Page et Perrotton 2017). Il est vrai que tant que le modèle est utilisé comme objet intermédiaire (Star et Griesemer, 1989), et que seules les dynamiques sociales qui ont lieu à l'extérieur de celui-ci sont interrogées par la démarche, l'exploration et la validation de modèle ne sont que secondaires. Mais quand le statut du modèle glisse vers un usage dans le cadre de prises de décision sur des résultats, et cela bien que le modèle ait été co-construit, les enjeux de l'exploration de modèle reprennent toute leur importance. Nous nous sommes questionnés sur le changement de posture induit par les outils méthodologiques et techniques véhiculés par les besoins de calcul lié à l'exploration ou à la validation de modèle. En effet, dans les démarches ComMod, si des trésors d'ingéniosité sont déployés pour atténuer les barrières entre modélisateurs et acteurs, nous ne voulons pas les abandonner à un moment aussi crucial. Nous proposons, en partant des implications de la posture du modélisateur, quelques pistes à explorer pour avancer avec les acteurs vers de l'accompagnement à l'exploration de modèle (ComExp). On s'intéressera principalement aux potentiels de la méthode PSE (Pattern Space Exploration) (Chérel et al. 2015) à utiliser dans un contexte de modélisation d'accompagnement.},

This paper presents the results of a four-country study conducted in 2017 in Nepal, Bhutan, India and Myanmar concerning the governance quality of CBFMS. The introduction outlines the global threat to forests, the contribution that forest-based emissions make to climate change, and the policy response of the international and national communities including REDD + . The next section provides a snapshot of CBFMS in the four case study countries, and is followed by an account of the methodology, approach, framework of analysis and sampling surveys undertaken during the course of, and informing, the research. The results of the surveys revealed that perceptions of governance quality, as well as governance priorities, varied between the countries, and also at the three levels of government (national, sub-national and local) within a country. For example, Myanmar and Bhutan had very high governance ratings from local levels compared to other levels, whereas, Nepal and India had similar ratings for all levels. Further, regarding the prioritisation of different indicators, Myanmar gave highest priority to “inclusiveness” at the local level but “democracy” at the national level. The reasons for the similarities and differences between and within these countries and the possible implications are discussed.},

This article focuses on the 4 per 1000 Initiative, which the French government launched to foster soil carbon sequestration with an international scope. We present and discuss the multidisciplinary design of our research, the methodological tensions that it entailed and the assets that it eventually represented for a better consideration of soil agency and vulnerability. Drawing on an in-depth qualitative investigation, we discuss soil carbon sequestration promises in light of the broader politics of soil knowledge. We argue that the 4 per 1000 promise may have failed to give adequate attention to soil’s complex agency (e.g. its capacity to both release and sequester carbon and other greenhouse gases) and soil’s vulnerability (e.g. to urbanisation and intensive agriculture, which have long been causing soil degradation, including carbon loss). Committing to a richer conception of soil agency and soil fragility is crucial to enact the social and environmental conditions for fostering efficient and sustainable technological and political change in relation to climate change.},

	abstract = {Variance based methods have assessed themselves as versatile and effective among the various available techniques for sensitivity analysis of model output. Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y=f(X1,X2,…,Xk) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f(X1,X2,…,Xk) needed to complete the analysis, as f(X1,X2,…,Xk) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to use.},

Model validation is commonly done by verifying that the model is able to reproduce the patterns to be explained. We argue that robust validation must not only be based on corroboration, but also on attempting to falsify the model, i.e. making sure that the model behaves soundly for any reasonable input and parameter values. We propose an open-ended evolutionary method based on Novelty Search to look for the diverse patterns a model can produce. The Pattern Space Exploration method was tested on a model of collective motion and compared to three common a priori sampling experiment designs. The method successfully discovered all known qualitatively different kinds of collective motion, and performed much better than the a priori sampling methods. The method was then applied to a case study of city system dynamics to explore the model’s predicted values of city hierarchisation and population growth. This case study showed that the method can provide insights on potential predictive scenarios as well as falsifiers of the model when the simulated dynamics are highly unrealistic.},

Using three key time periods (years) 1975, 2000, and 2013 the atlas describes major land cover transformations over the past 40 years in each country and across the region as a whole. The drivers of change, as well as their environmental and socioeconomic effects, are also discussed. The story is told through maps with statistics that detail the rate, magnitude, and location of land cover change. Beyond words, the atlas makes ample use of photographs and satellite imagery to make land cover change more understandable to the people living in West Africa and around the globe.},

	abstract = {Since the 1960s, droughts have caused significant degradation of Sahelian ecosystems, particularly resulting in a reduction in tree cover. Despite the challenges posed by climate change, the rural Sahelian population continues to depend on natural resources for pastoral livestock farming, which remains a critical source of livelihood. To address this issue of land degradation, Sahelian states and international coalitions are prioritizing efforts to restore pastoral land through reforestation programs. These initiatives aim to enhance ecosystem services, generate new income for the population, and safeguard biodiversity.In practice, however, reforestation has often led to a depletion of resources for communities due to enclosure policies. This paper explores various land management models for reforestation within a pastoral context through provisioning ecosystem services (PES) modeling.This study quantifies the economic potential of PES offered by reforestation programs in Senegal. It employs a quantitative methodology to assess the profitability of these operations from the perspective of pastoral economies. The analysis reveals that the PES benefits of reforestation can significantly enhance the economic potential of sylvo-pastoral productions if resource access is negotiated collaboratively between pastoralists and forestry extension services during reforestation activities and after. From an investment perspective, the economic viability of reforestation operations in drylands is questionable. The findings suggest that when evaluated solely in terms of PES profitability, these programs may not be financially sustainable. The sustainability of these investments would require taking into account supporting and regulating ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Le paradigme multi-agent qui propose une manière originale de modéliser le monde, est considéré comme un mode pertinent de représentation des connaissances. Mais ces potentialités ne doivent pas cacher les difficultés qui guettent le modélisateur. Souvent sous-estimées, celles-ci peuvent remettre en cause sa légitimité scientifique. La question de la validation des SMA est soulevée et plus spécifiquement leur fiabilité. Contrairement aux modèles mathématiques, un SMA ne peut pas prouver ses résultats ni s'abstraire de la simulation. Lors du passage de sa conception à son implémentation, de nombreux artefacts peuvent apparaître. Certains sont liés à des erreurs de programmation ou de calcul, mais la plupart proviennent d'une gestion approximative du temps et des interactions entre agents. On risque ainsi d'attribuer par erreur des propriétés à un modèle. Or la technique informatique seule ne résout pas ces biais. Le concepteur doit connaître les zones sensibles susceptibles de générer des artefacts et les considérer dans le cadre du domaine traité. Après avoir mené des analyses exploratoires, il contrôle mieux son système et est capable d'expliquer tous les résultats produits. Pour renforcer la fiabilité du simulateur, il est aussi nécessaire de le répliquer de façon indépendante, à l'instar de toute démarche scientifique rigoureuse. Or les difficultés de la réplication sont souvent dues au manque de lisibilité des SMA. Si la parfaite explicitation reste un idéal, il est indispensable de présenter un SMA de façon claire et non ambiguë à l'aide de diagrammes réorganisés qui mettent la lumière sur les points essentiels et permettre des discussions et des critiques},

	abstract = {Rural communities are taking active roles in conservation. However, the basic modes and content of community participatory approach are seldom summarised or reflected on in China, leaving the use of terms confused and their links to practice disconnected. By reviewing the literature, we traced back to the protected area-community relations from the perspective of features of rural communities, namely knowledge accumulation, social bond, collective actions, and risk-aversion, and reflected on changing roles of community conservation through recognition of these features. Combining case studies and our own research experience, we focused on the de facto practices behind the somewhat casual use of several terms and re-classified community participation in conservation to three modes of community participatory management, community co-management, and community dominant management, along a continuum in which, from low to high level, conservation is more a means rather than an end for the community to be empowered for their own resource management. We argued that the success of community participation must ensure stable and flexible land tenure so that the right to benefit can be guaranteed, and the collective action in managing resources can be achieved by empowerment. In practice, further institutional changes of improvement in the legislation and optimisation in benefit sharing and compensation are needed to promote community participation in a broader social participation context.},

It analyzes the perceptions of 612 respondents living in 15 settlements surrounding two protected areas in Serbia. The findings reveal that the locals have a very positive attitude about the impact of protected areas through benefits and protection of resources. They have a very strong sense of belonging to the place and are willing to contribute to protection, but they feel excluded, which is worrisome. A different approach of management that would respect the rights and the existence of the local people is required to prevent conflicts and foster mutual respect and benefit-sharing for everyone.},

By using a political ecology approach, three case studies of natural resource management are analyzed which span industrialized and developing world contexts—agro-ecological zoning in the western Amazon, a social forestry project in the southern Philippines, and a forest plan revision process in southern Utah. We suggest the need for more attention to how communities are defined and how participation is formalized by institutions, as well as to contested meanings of conservation. We find that, despite espousing agendas of community-based conservation, international and state agencies retain authority over key decisions about natural resource management, use, and allocation.},

	abstract = {Governance gaps at both the federal and state level increasingly necessitate local action and remain a key driver of community-based solutions. A localist paradigm—encompassing models such as community-based management, citizen science, and cooperative research—offers a promising approach for bridging governance gaps by engaging citizens, co-producing knowledge, fostering trust, and developing innovative solutions to address complex conservation challenges. Yet, despite notable successes, significant barriers constrain widespread implementation of localist approaches. This is particularly evident in natural resource-dependent communities. Rural communities are increasingly faced with a range of conservation challenges related to rapid climate and land-use changes but often they lack the capacity to support locally based initiatives to better anticipate, plan for, and mitigate these changes. We examined four diverse conservation cases based on localist approaches in Maine, USA, to bring to the fore key factors that influence outcomes in different social-ecological contexts. We compared cases along three frequently discussed dimensions—governance systems, social adaptive capacities, and technology and data characteristics and found that localist outcomes vary widely depending on key metrics within each of these dimensions. There is no single way to advance localism, but we offer multiple ways to incorporate a community-based perspective into management. This synthesis of data from our collective participatory research projects provides guidance to maximize the potential of localist conservation approaches in complex social and biophysical arenas.},

	abstract = {The trees in agroforestry plots create spatial heterogeneity of high interest for adaptation, mitigation, and the provision of ecosystem services. But to what distance, exactly, from the tree? We tested a novel approach, based upon geostatistics and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) sensing, to infer the distance at which a single agroforestry tree affects the surrounding under-crop, to map yield, litter (i.e. stover) and compute crop-partial Land Equivalent Ratio (LERcp) at the whole-plot level. In an agro-silvo-pastoral parkland of semi-arid western Africa dominated by the multi-purpose tree Faidherbia albida, we harvested the pearl-millet under-crop at the whole-plot scale (ca. 1 ha) and also in subplot transects, at three distances from the trunks. We observed that the yield was three times higher below the tree crown (135.6 g m−2) than at a distance of five tree-crown radii from the trunk (47.7 g m−2). Through geostatistical analysis of multi-spectral, centimetric-resolution images obtained from an UAV overflight of the entire plot, we determined that the ‘Range’ parameter of the semi-variogram (assumed to be the distance of influence of the trees on the Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) was 17 m. We correlated the yield (r2 = 0.41; RRMSE = 48 \%) and litter production (r2 = 0.46; RRMSE = 35 \%) in subplots with NDVI, and generated yield and litter maps at the whole-plot scale. The measured whole-plot yield (0.73 t ha-1) differed from the one estimated via the UAV mapping by only 20 \%, thereby validating the overall approach. The litter was estimated similarly at 1.05 tC ha-1 yr-1 and mapped. Using a geostatistical proxy for the sole crop, LERcp was estimated 1.16, despite the low tree density. This new method to handle heterogeneity in agroforestry systems is a first application. We also propose strategies for extension to the landscape level.},

Notre contribution s’intéresse à étudier les modes de gestion de ces parcs dans deux sites du département de Bambey situé dans le bassin arachidier du Sénégal. Ces deux sites contrastés, notamment en termes de densité d’arbres, sont pourtant soumis aux mêmes politiques de gestion et de conservation des espaces arborés. Nous faisons ici l’hypothèse que les différences paysagères observées sont dues à des déterminants locaux et des pratiques de gestion différentes. Pour comprendre les facteurs explicatifs de cette hétérogénéité, nous avons enquêté un ensemble d’acteurs intervenant dans la gestion de l’arbre dans les deux sites d’étude. Plus particulièrement, nous nous sommes intéressés aux questions de gouvernance locale, aux usages et utilités de l’arbre, ainsi qu’aux pratiques paysannes vis-à-vis de cette ressource. Les résultats de l’étude indiquent que les modes de gestion paysanne jouent un rôle prédominant dans la structuration du paysage arboré. Les fonctions multiples qu’assure l’arbre font que les paysans opèrent une sélection des arbres qu’ils jugent utiles. Cette sélection paysanne additionnée aux considérations sociales qui diffèrent d’un terroir à un autre fait que les parcs arborés diffèrent d’une parcelle à l’autre et d’un village à l’autre.},
